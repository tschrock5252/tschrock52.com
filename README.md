### Architecture Explanation
#### Public Traffic Flow
##### Client -> Firewall Edge
 - Public traffic resolves the DNS name tschrock52.com to my public IP address.
 - Once traffic flows into my pfSense firewall on port 443, it hits an HAProxy frontend.
 - The HAPRoxy frontend uses a wildcard certificate from LetsEncrypt to provide secure SSL encryption.
 - HAProxy has a backend tied to this frontend and custom configuration options defined.

###### HAProxy's Http check version:
```
HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:\ www.tschrock52.com\r\nAccept:\ */*
```
###### HAProxy's Backend pass thru:
```
http-request set-header Host www.tschrock52.com
```
##### MetalLB / kube-proxy / ingress -> Service
 - HAProxyâ€™s backend forwards decrypted HTTP traffic to the MetalLB-assigned LoadBalancer IP (10.1.0.x) for the ingress-nginx-controller Service.
   - Note: This external IP is configured and working due to MetalLB's controller pod configuring an external IP for the ingress-nginx-controller.
 - kube-proxy on the node receives traffic for the external Load Balancer IP on a port (say 80 or 443).
 - kube-proxy uses iptables/ipvs rules to forward the traffic to one of the ingress-nginx-controller Pods based on the Service definition.
 - The ingress-nginx-controller pod processes the HTTP/HTTPS request based on configured Ingress rules.
 - The ingress-nginx-controller uses the NGINX web server to process the request and route it to the correct service in the cluster (tschrock52-service).
   - Note: The NGINX web server is configured with a custom configMap that sets up a default backend for 404 errors.
##### Service -> Site Pods -> Client
 - The tschrock52-service forwards the request to the correct pod (tschrock52-site-aaaaaaaaaa-bbbbb/schrock52-site-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy).
 - The pod processes the request and returns a response to the client.
